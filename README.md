## Dont't forget to make:

- Remember that all the users are in seed file, so you can test the organization administrator priviledges.
- Examples:
     - General Admin:
          - admin@admin.com / password: admin123
     - Organization Admin:
          - rai@gmail.com / password: rai123
     - Normal User:
          - luisg@gmail.com / password: gonzalez
