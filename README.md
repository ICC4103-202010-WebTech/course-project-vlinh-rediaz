## We want to make emphasis that we take more care about the back-end than the front-end. But anyways it's far better from before.
- ADM: It's available to perform CRUD operations on Organzations, Events and Events comments. ✔✔
- UPR: You can make everything needed, view user profile, edit user profile, edit user fields: name, bio, location; View events to which the user has been invited, view created events. ✔✔
- ORG: Everything working. ✔✔
- EV: Work everything, except from:
     - Start event date vote.
     - Configure event date vote.
     - Vote for event date. 
      And viewing videos and files attach, it's only possible to upload 1. ✔❌
